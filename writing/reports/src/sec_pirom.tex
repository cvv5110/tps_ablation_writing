\section{Physics-Infused Reduced-Order Modeling}\label{sec_pirom}

The formulation of PIROM for ablating TPS starts by mathematically connecting the FOM, i.e.g, DG-FEM, and the reduced-physics model, i.e., the LCM, via a coarse-graining procedure. This procedure pinpoints the missing dynamics in the LCM when compared to DG-FEM. Subsequently, the Mori-Zwanzig formalism is employed to determine the model form for the missing dynamics in PIROM. Lastlty, the data-driven identification of the missing dynanmics in PIROM is presented.
